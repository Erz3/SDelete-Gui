A very simple utility that adds a new option to the Windows context menu (right click menu) for securely deleting files and folders, using a United States Department of Defense compliant algorithm.

This tool only adds the right menu option, it uses [SDelete](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897443.aspx) of [Microsoft Sysinternals](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb545021.aspx) written by [Mark Russinovich](http://blogs.technet.com/b/markrussinovich/). The tool will download SDelete from Microsoft's web site.
